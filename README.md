## 🧾 Editing Your Data (`data.json`)

All personal, academic, and project information is stored in **`public/data.json`**.
This allows the entire site content to be updated without modifying React components.

### Example snippet:

```json
{
  "header": {
    "name": "Mohammad Alaei",
    "title": "Researcher in Human–AI Interaction and Cognitive Computing",
    "social": {
      "GitHub": "https://github.com/alaeimo",
      "LinkedIn": "https://linkedin.com/in/alaeimo"
    }
  },
  "research_interests": {
    "description": "<p>My research lies at the intersection of <strong>human behavior</strong>, <em>cognitive computing</em>, and <strong>AI-driven personalization</strong>...</p>"
  }
}
```

💡 **Tip:** You can use basic HTML formatting (`<b>`, `<i>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, etc.) inside `data.json` text fields for italics, bold, and paragraph breaks.

After making changes, simply re-run:

```bash
npm start
```

or rebuild with:

```bash
npm run build
```

---
