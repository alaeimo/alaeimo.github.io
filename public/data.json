My core research directions include:\n\n - **Personalization and Recommender Systems**: Designing adaptive systems that learn from individual cognitive patterns and preferences to offer genuinely personalized experiences for learning, reflection, and decision support.\n\n - **Human–AI Interaction and Cognitive Computing**: Exploring how AI can collaborate meaningfully with humans-anticipating needs, supporting complex reasoning, and fostering insight-guided by the belief that technology should enhance understanding, not just efficiency.\n\n - **Computational Modeling of Human Behavior**: Developing predictive models that capture the layered dynamics of thought, emotion, and decision-making, grounded in both cognitive science and the philosophy of mind.\n\n - **Affective Computing**: Infusing emotional intelligence into AI systems to recognize, interpret, and respond to human affect, aiming to promote engagement, empathy, and mental well-being.\n\n - **Digital Twins for Self-Knowledge and Human-Aware Systems**: Building computational representations of the self that illuminate patterns of cognition and behavior, connecting technology with self-awareness and long-term human flourishing.\n\nAcross these areas, my goal is to bring together **scientific rigor**, **computational creativity**, and **human meaning**, to build systems that not only advance AI but also help us better understand ourselves."
